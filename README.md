# Flask To-Do List App

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple **To-Do List App** built using **Flask**. I created this project as a fun way to practice Flask and get hands-on experience with web development. I've always wanted a **customized to-do app**, and building one myself was a great learning experience!

## 🛠 Features
- **Add Tasks** - Easily add new tasks to the list.  
- **Delete Tasks** - Remove completed or unnecessary tasks.  
- **Clear List** - Reset the entire task list.  
- **Simple UI** - A clean and minimal interface.  
- **Persistent Storage** - Tasks are stored in a text file (`tasks.txt`).  

## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── app.py                # Main Flask application
├── tasks.txt             # Stores the to-do list items
├── templates/
│   ├── home.html         # Frontend template for displaying tasks
```

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-project-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Flask:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Run the Flask app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the app in your browser:**
   Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## 🚀 Usage
- Open the app in your browser.
- Add tasks using the input box.
- Click on a task to remove it from the list.
- Use the "Clear List" button to reset the entire task list.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Flask routing and request handling.
- Handling file operations in Python.
- Using HTML templates with Flask.
- Building a simple web app from scratch!

## 🤝 Future Improvements
- Add a database (SQLite or PostgreSQL) for better task management.
- Implement a front-end framework like React or Vue.
- Add a due-date feature for tasks.

### 🎉 This was a fun project, and I'm excited to keep improving it!
